# Installation
==============

WhiteLab 2.0 can be used either with BlackLab as its backend (recommended), or with the new Neo4J backend (under development). 

NB: Basic knowledge of Linux application and server management is assumed.

NB: Since the index may take up quite some resources, it is advised to run the WhiteLab 2.0 backend on its own dedicated server. 
The installation and configuration instructions provided assume that this is the case. The web application may be hosted on another
server, since it uses REST calls to communicate with the index.
